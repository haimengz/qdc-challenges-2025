    "# Scattering and particle creation in 1D Ising Field Theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03111.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is to study the time evolution of two localized single-particle states within a 1D Ising field theory as they evolve towards and scatter off each other. For our choice of coupling parameters and initial energy, an inelastic process can occur in which energy is converted to mass -- specifically, the scattered state contains a particle of higher mass than the incoming state. A goal of this challenge is to detect a signal of the aforementioned inelastic scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scattering processes are visualized in the picture below: two \"light\" particles move towards each other, collide, and either: 1) scatter elastically, 2) scatter *in*elastically (with an out-going heavier, slower-moving particle moving to the  **left**), or 3) scatter  *in*elastically (with an out-going heavier, slower-moving particle moving to the  **right**). All processes appear in the figure because they occur in superposition.  \n",

    "### Implement a quantum simulation of high-energy particle collision in 1D Ising field theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will first run matrix product state (MPS) simulations of scattering on a small lattice (PART I), and then we will run hardware experiments of scattering on a large lattice (PART II). You will have freedom to improve upon the experiment with error mitigation and post-processing techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For both MPS simulation and hardware experiments, there are a few basic steps involved: \n",
    "1. **Prepare an initial state that has two wavepackets with definite momentum $k_0$.** We will call each wavepacket state $|W(k_0)\\rangle$ due to the fact that it is a special case of the $W$-state, and we will prepare two of them separated over space within the lattice and with opposite momentum, such that they are moving towards each other. \n",
    "2. **Minimize the energy of the initial state without changing the momentum.** This step ensures that we begin with the lowest-energy excited state that corresponds to the single-particle state with largest mass in our Ising theory, set by parameters $g_x$ and $g_z$. This will be implemented for you using a method called ADAPT-VQE with pre-determined parameters. \n",
    "3. **Evolve under the Ising Hamiltonian.** With a large enough initial energy $E_{\\text{tot}}>m + m$ (setting the speed of light $c=1$), an *inelastic collision* can occur in which a heavier, slower-moving particle with mass $M$ is produced. ***A goal of simulations like this is to observe this process.***\n",
    "4. **Implement error mitigation and post-processing (PART II only).** These experiments operate at the *utility-scale*, requiring a large number of qubits and a substantial two-qubit gate depth. Error mitigation and post-processing are necessary to refine the experimental signal. \n",

    "The evolved vacuum circuit is a good candidate for the mitigation circuit because the vacuum state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, so as it evolves, its properties (theoretically) remain unchanged; any change that is observed can be attributed to decoherence. Moreoever, these properties are easy to compute in simulation because the vacuum can be prepared with a shallow circuit, requiring only the constant-depth `adapt_vqe_circ`. The signal strengths for evolution up to time $t$ can then be computed as: $$p_{\\hat{O}} = \\frac{\\langle \\psi_{\\text{vac}} | \\hat{U}^{\\dagger}_2(t) \\hat{O} \\hat{U}_2(t) |\\psi_{\\text{vac}}\\rangle_{\\text{meas}}}{\\langle \\psi_{\\text{vac}} |\\hat{O} |\\psi_{\\text{vac}} \\rangle_{\\text{pred}}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's generate the set of predicted observables by using the MPS simulator to prepare $|\\psi_{\\text{vac}}\\rangle$. We will also go ahead and simulate the initial observables predicted for the set of wavepackets, so that we can compute the vacuum-subtracted total energy of the initial state. This will be important for some post-processing."

    "Hopefully, you have observed some signal of scattering. You may have observed that as $t$ is increased and the circuits become deeper, the measured signal becomes increasingly noisy. To see *inelastic scattering* requires going to $t \\geq 25$ -- requiring a large circuit depth and sophisticated methods of error mitigation to combat the noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of the challenge, you have freedom to try and improve your results. One possible path that we have alluded to is the use of fractional gates ($R_{ZZ}$ rotations) in the Trotter steps, cutting the two-qubit gate depth of the time-evolution circuit in half. However, currently, using the `Estimator` to implement twirling with fractional gates is not supported -- yet twirling is essential for the use of ODR! It is possible to implement twirling \"by hand\" using a reduced set of Paulis; see, e.g, Fig. 15 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03111. Note also that due to the overall negative sign in the Hamiltonian, the required $R_{ZZ}$ rotations will have an argument $\\theta$ outside of the allowed range for native implementation when evolving forward in time. Additional single-qubit gates will arise in transpilation to account for this. To avoid this additional single-qubit gate overhead, the original authors opted to evolve *backwards* in time ($\\delta_t < 0$). This requires that the wavepackets be set up with swapped initial momentum (left wavepacket with negative momentum and right wavepacket with positive momentum) in order to observe scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another pathway might be adjusting $\\delta_t$ to explore the tradeoff between Trotterization error and decoherence due to large two-qubit gate depth, or increasing the number of twirls, or exploring other methods of error mitigation. \n",

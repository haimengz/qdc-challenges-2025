    "As an alternative approach, you can run your jobs using the **SamplerV2** primitive to obtain **raw bitstrings**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Follow this workflow:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the relevant operators**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Construct local $Z$-Pauli operators (one per qubit).  \n",
    "   * Define the *Gauss law (gauge) operators* based on the lattice:  \n",
    "     $G_n = \\tau^z_n \\prod_{v \\in \\ell_n} \\sigma^z_{(n,v)}$  \n",
    "   * Collect these into sets of observables and postselection operators.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Postselection**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use the Gauss law operators to filter out measurement outcomes (bitstrings) that are **not physically valid**:  \n",
    "      $G_n |\\psi\\rangle \\neq |\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "   * This ensures that only samples consistent with the **gauge constraints** are retained.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reconstruct observables from bitstrings**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   * From the valid samples, compute expectation values of **diagonal observables**.  \n",
    "   * Carefully match the order of observables to the qubit layout in your logical circuits so that indices remain consistent with previous steps.  \n",
    "   * Compare results **with and without postselection** to assess performance improvements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to organize your code as you prefer — for instance, you might create helper functions for postselection, observable measurement, and related tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08088), we take this approach a step further by implementing **Gauss Sector Correction (GSC)** to actively correct bit-flip errors.  When a bit-flip occurs and the Gauss law is violated, instead of discarding the sample, one can identify the most likely error and determine the recovery operation to reverse it and project the state back onto the physical subspace. This is achieved using a $G_n$ stabilizer code, which — while not fully fault-tolerant — still provides a degree of partial error correction.  \n",

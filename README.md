## Challenge Notebooks

Throughout QDC, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in hands-on coding challenges inspired by recent, impactful results from the quantum computing community.

These challenges are designed to help you practice using the latest tools and features highlighted in the seminars. There is no single path to the right solution, so participants are encouraged to think creatively and explore different approaches to extract maximum performance from the hardware and software tools. The challenge creators, Qiskit developers, and members of IBM’s Quantum Algorithm Engineering team will be available throughout the event to offer guidance and discuss ideas.

You’ll work in Jupyter notebooks, which are available in this dedicated GitHub repository. To ensure the best possible experience, please complete the preparation steps outlined in the repository’s README before the event.

Each day will include dedicated time to work on challenges. Your team will be assigned to one of two tracks, each covering a diverse range of application domains to accommodate different skills and interests. Leaderboards will display team scores for each challenge in real time. At the end of the event, awards will be given on a per-track basis—the team with the highest overall score across all challenges in each track will win.

Participants will have until Friday, November 14, at 13:00 ET to submit their solutions. Winners will be announced during the award ceremony at 16:00 on the same day.

The challenge notebooks can be found in their respective Track folders. See below for a summary of the topics covered by each challenge:

## Learning Resources

The seminars and challenges at QDC are designed to cover a broad range of advanced topics featuring Qiskit tools and capabilities. While participants are not expected to have a deep understanding of everything that will be covered we do recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics before attending the event. 

See the [cheat sheet](./challenges_cheat_sheet.md) for more information and links to various resources which may help get you started.
